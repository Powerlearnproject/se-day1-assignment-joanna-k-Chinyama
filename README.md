#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is a branch of computer science that systematically applies engineering principles, methods, and tools to develop and maintain high-quality software systems.It deals with the design, development, testing, deployment and maintenance of software applications.
The importance of software engineering in the technology indudustry is that it plays a key role in enenabling the creation and development of software applications and systems that power various aspects of modern life, including communication, commerce, entertainment, and healthcare.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
 The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C),played a key role in the evolution of software engineering.programming languages  save as primary tools that developers use to write code,allowing them to be able to communicate instructions to computers in a way that is understood by both humans and executable by machines.The development of programming languages made it easy for developers to create and develop software applications.
 The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s, which was a response to the growing complexity and challenges in software development.This led to the formal recognition of software development as a distict field, aimed at applying engineering principles to software development.
 The advent of structured programming in the 1970s,which introduced a more  displined approach to software development that emphasized  the writing of code that is clear, readable and manageable which improved the clarity,quality and development time of a software program.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Requirements-Requiments involves the gathering and documenting of user needs and system requirements.
Design- design is the creating of high -level and detialed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
Implementation-Implementation involves the writing of code and building the software according to the designs specifications.
Testing-this involves conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
Deployment-Deployment is releasing the software to users and customers.
Maintenance-Maintenance involves providing ongoing support,updates and enhancements to the software after deployment.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall and Agile are both software  development methodologies.
Waterfall uses sequential approach with distinct phases (e.g, requirements, design, implementation) flowing downwards like a waterfall, while Agile uses an iterative and incremental approach focused on flexibility, collaboration, and responding to change.
Waterfall has a rigid structure, while Agile has a flexible and adaptive structure.
Waterfall requires all project requirements to be gathered and documented before development begins, while Agile emphasizes adaptive planning in which initial requirements are defined but detailed planning occurs continuously throughout the project.
Waterfall is suitable to use when working on short and simple projects, while Agile is suitable to use when working on large complex projects.
Example scenarios:
Waterfall-Developing a patient records systems for a hospital, where requirements are strictly  defined and need to comply with regulatory standards.
Agile-building a mobile app for a startup where the target audience is rapidly evolving, and frequent feedback is needed to refine features and user experience

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
SoftwareDeveloper-responsible for writing code and inplementing software solutions.
Quality Asurance Engineer-ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
Project Manager-oversees the planning,execution and delivery of software projects.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
Integrated Development Environment are important software suites that provides comprehensive tools for writing,debugging and testing code, for example Visual studio code.
Version control systems are important software tools for tracking changes to software code and cordinating work among team members, for example Git

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Changing Requirments-requirments may change during the development cycle,leading to scope creep and project delays.
Tight Deadlines-pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
Technical Debt-accrued from shortcuts or subotimal solutions,technical dept can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
The above challenges can be overcome by using Agile methodologies that are more flexible and responsive to change  reducing  the risk of building a product that does not meet user and customer needs,as adjustment are made throughout the development process and has an adaptable timeline that is flexible and can be adjusted based on ongoing feedback and changing requirments.other strategies used to overcome challenges involve effective comunication,priotization of tasks,regular reassessment of project goals and timelines.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit Testing is the individual testing  of components or peices of code (e.g functions) in isolotion from the rest of the application.Its important as it ensures that each unit of the software works correctly on its own.helps in identifying and fixing  bugs at an early stage,making the debugging process easier.its  also important as it serves as documentation for code,helping developers understand the functionality of specific units.
Integration is a type of testing that focuses on verifying the interactions between different components or modules of the software to ensure they work together  as expected .its purpose is to test the integration points between units to detect issues related to interface mismatches ,data flow and interaction logic.its important  as it ensures module interactions, identifies interface issues such us detect problems that may not be apparent during unit testing, such as data mismatch. its important as it facilitates system integration  making the transition from individual components to fully integrated systems smoother and less error prone.
System testing is a type of testing that involves testing of the complete  and fully integrated software system to ensure it meets the specified requirements. its purpose is to validate end-to-end functionality of the software in an environment that closely mirrors the production setup. It is important in end-to-end validation ensuring that the entire system functions as intended from start to finish. Ensures requirement  verification as well as real-world simulation.
Acceptance testing is the final stage of testing, where the software is tested from end-user perspective to determine if it ready for deployment. its purpose is to ensure that the software  meets business requirements and is acceptable to the user ,client or stakeholders .It is  importance as it ensures user satisfaction as well as  final verification which acts as the last check before the  software is released ,ensuring that all requirements have been met.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering.
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engneering is the process of designing imputs to effectively interact with AI models in order  to generate desired outputs.
prompt engineering is impportant as it ensures that AI models produce accurate and relevant outputs.
prompt engineering is important as it improves the responce quility of AI models,enhances efficiency and helps control  AI behaviour.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
vague prompt -Make me a drawing
improved prompt-generate a sunflower pencil drawing.
The improved prompt is more effective as it is clear and specifically telling the  AI model what the drawing should be of and what it should look like, making it easy
for the AI model to generate  desired outputs.
